KeenBench - Company Context (Fictional QA Data)

QA marker: KEENBENCH_COMPANY_CONTEXT=V1

Company snapshot
- Name: KeenBench
- Stage: early-stage startup (small team, shipping weekly)
- What we build: KeenBench, a desktop app that helps people turn messy source material (notes, spreadsheets, PDFs, slide decks) into clean, reviewable deliverables.
- Primary users: founders, operators, and analysts who write briefs, memos, reports, and internal docs from real inputs.

What "KeenBench" means (use these terms consistently)
- Workbench: the workspace that holds the current file set, context items, and conversation.
- Workshop: the chat interface used to request analysis or edits.
- Draft: the proposed set of file changes produced by the model. It is not published yet.
- Review: the offline diff/preview UI where the user decides what to publish.
- Publish / Published: applying Draft changes to the published workspace state.

Positioning (how we describe the product)
- "Document work, with guardrails": model-assisted editing, but changes are always reviewable before publish.
- Egress consent is explicit: users must consent before any workbench content is sent to a model provider.
- We optimize for reliable workflows over flashy demos.

Audience + constraints
- Assume the user is busy and wants outcomes fast.
- When writing guidance, be practical and step-by-step.
- Avoid hype, vague claims, and marketing language.

Values (how we communicate)
- Accuracy over confidence. If something is unknown, say so and propose a way to verify.
- Clarity over cleverness. Use plain language, short sections, and concrete examples.
- Safety and consent by default. Never suggest bypassing review/publish guardrails.

Preferred writing style for KeenBench deliverables
- Tone: calm, direct, specific.
- Structure: headings + short paragraphs + bullets.
- Numbers: use concrete dates and measurable targets when available.
- Formatting: use monospace for file paths, code, and commands.
