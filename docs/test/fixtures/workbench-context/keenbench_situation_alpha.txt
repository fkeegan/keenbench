KeenBench - Situation Context (Fictional QA Data)

QA marker: KEENBENCH_SITUATION_TAG=HNDY-LAUNCH-ALPHA-4187

You are helping the KeenBench team prepare a launch-ready set of documents.

Situation tag (keep this line exact in the processed context): KEENBENCH_SITUATION_TAG=HNDY-LAUNCH-ALPHA-4187

Current focus
- Deliverable: "KeenBench v0.9 Launch Memo" (internal) plus a short customer-facing brief.
- Audience: internal team + 2 design partners (security-conscious, prefer evidence over hype).
- Deadline: 2026-02-21 (Friday). Treat this as hard.

Constraints
- Keep claims grounded. If a feature is not shipped, label it as "planned" or "in progress".
- Emphasize the workflow: Workbench -> Workshop -> Draft -> Review -> Publish.
- Do not invent customer names. If an example customer is needed, use "Design Partner A" and "Design Partner B".
- Do not remove or paraphrase the Situation tag line.

Success criteria
- The memo is scannable (headings + bullets) and can be read in under 5 minutes.
- The customer brief is 1 page (or equivalent length) and uses a confident-but-cautious tone.
