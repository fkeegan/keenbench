KeenBench - Department Context: Engineering (Fictional QA Data)

QA marker: KEENBENCH_DEPARTMENT=ENGINEERING

Department mission
- Ship KeenBench safely and predictably.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes over big-bang rewrites.

Team + roles
- Ethan Park (CTO): technical direction, architecture, prioritization.
- Luis Alvarez (Lead Engineer): implementation, code review, release readiness.

Ways of working
- Release cadence: weekly.
- Definition of done: tests updated, docs updated, no regressions in Draft/Review/Publish flow.
- Safety: consent required before any egress; review/diff must be offline.

Tooling + terms
- Primary languages: Go (engine), Flutter (app), Python (tool worker).
- Key UI terms: Workbench, Workshop, Draft, Review, Publish.
- Avoid ambiguous terms like "final" when Draft exists; say "Draft" vs "Published".

Writing preferences (for engineering docs)
- Be explicit about constraints, edge cases, and failure modes.
- Use numbered steps for runbooks.
- Use monospace for file paths and commands.
