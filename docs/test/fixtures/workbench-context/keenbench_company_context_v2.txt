KeenBench - Company Context (Fictional QA Data)

QA marker: KEENBENCH_COMPANY_CONTEXT=V2

Company snapshot
- Name: KeenBench
- Stage: early-stage startup (4 people, customer discovery + rapid iteration)
- What we build: KeenBench, a desktop app for assisted analysis and drafting with a strict review/publish workflow.
- Primary users: people who produce documents from source inputs: operators, analysts, consultants, and product leads.

Positioning update (what changed vs V1)
- We explicitly target "high-stakes writing": policies, board updates, customer summaries, and internal runbooks.
- We prioritize consistency: context items are used to keep tone and formatting stable across sessions.

Non-negotiables
- Edits must land in Draft first; users approve via Review before publishing.
- Consent is required before sending any workbench content to a model provider.

Values
- Be precise. Prefer verifiable claims.
- Be readable. Use simple formatting and avoid jargon.
- Be honest about uncertainty and limitations.

Preferred writing style for KeenBench deliverables
- Short sentences. Avoid filler.
- Use bullets for lists and checklists.
- When referencing dates, use YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2026-02-13).
