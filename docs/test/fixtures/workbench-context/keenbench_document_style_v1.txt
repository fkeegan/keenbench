KeenBench - Document Style & Formatting (Fictional QA Data)

QA marker: KEENBENCH_DOC_STYLE=V1

These rules apply to KeenBench deliverables (memos, one-pagers, PRDs, customer briefs).

Layout
- First page: include the KeenBench logo at the top-right with a small margin (use `engine/testdata/office/logo.svg` as the source asset).
- If the file format cannot embed the SVG, use the text "KEENBENCH" top-right instead.
- Keep generous whitespace; prefer clean pages over dense walls of text.

Typography
- Body: Inter (or closest available sans-serif), 14px equivalent.
- Headings: slightly heavier weight than body.
- Monospace: JetBrains Mono for code blocks, file paths, and commands.

Color (match the UI style guide)
- Background: warm off-white (#FDFCFB) where applicable.
- Text: near-black (#1F1F1F) for primary, warm gray (#6B6560) for secondary.
- Accent: muted blue (#5B7FC2) for key callouts and link styling.
- Avoid saturated colors and heavy gradients.

Structure + writing
- Prefer headings + bullets.
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max).
- Avoid exclamation points, emojis, and salesy language.
- When giving instructions, use numbered steps.
