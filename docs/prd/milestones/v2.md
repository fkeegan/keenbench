# PRD: v2 Milestone

## Status
Draft

## Goal
Deliver power features for small teams: collaboration with shared Workbenches and approvals.

## In Scope

### Team Features (TBD)
The following are under consideration but require further scoping:
- Shared Workbenches with roles and publish approvals
- Team-level audit trail and activity history
- Identity/auth and team management

*Team features will be detailed in a separate PRD once v1.5 learnings are available.*

## Out of Scope
- Full marketplace with third-party publishing
- Full semantic diffs for all Office files (beyond v1.5 scope)
- Broad OS-level agent control

## User Flows

### Team Features User Flows (TBD)
- Team Workbench -> invite members -> assign roles -> run job -> approval gate -> publish

## Requirements

### Team Features (TBD — pending further scoping)
1. Shared Workbenches support roles (viewer/editor/approver) and publish approvals.
2. Audit trail includes execution activity and approval decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Team Features (TBD)
- Only approvers can publish; non-approvers can review and comment.
- Audit trail shows who ran jobs and who approved publishes.

## Dependencies

### Team Features Dependencies (TBD)
- Identity/auth and team management
- Shared Workbench storage and access control

## Telemetry
- Team Workbench adoption and approval cycle time

## Risks / Open Questions
~~How much friction does approval gating add to solo users?~~ → **Removed**: Empirical question to be determined through testing.
