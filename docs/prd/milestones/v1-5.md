# PRD: v1.5 Milestone

## Status
Draft

## Goal
Increase trust and output quality after v1 through better Office-file review, Workshop model comparison, improved cost estimates, and enhanced execution reporting.

## In Scope
- **"Try with another model" fork** for Workshop responses
- Concurrent Drafts support (required for Workshop comparison)
- Partial semantic diffs for DOCX/PPTX/XLSX (best-effort)
- Full accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Out of Scope
- Workflow templates (v2)
- Cloud sync or team collaboration features
- Connectors (Drive/Notion/email/calendar)
- Marketplace / third-party workflow store

## User Flows
- Workshop response -> "Try with another model" -> parallel response from different model -> compare and choose
- Review Office files -> see semantic diff summary + in-app before/after preview
Note: "Try with another model" for Workshop introduces concurrent Drafts, which are not available in v1.

## Requirements
1. "Try with another model" creates a parallel Workshop response using a different model.
2. Concurrent Drafts are supported and clearly labeled for Workshop comparisons.
3. Review UI supports best-effort semantic diffs for DOCX/PPTX/XLSX.
4. Accessibility audit completed and gaps addressed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can invoke "Try with another model" and compare parallel outputs.
- Forked Drafts are clearly labeled and do not overwrite each other (Workshop only).
- Office files show a semantic diff summary or fallback summary with in-app before/after preview.
- No v1 flow is broken by adding Workshop model comparison.
- Accessibility audit completed with documented compliance status.

## Dependencies
- Concurrent Draft storage and labeling
- Office file parsing and semantic diff tooling
- Accessibility testing tooling

## Telemetry
- "Try with another model" usage rate and selection outcome
- Office diff usage rate and fallback rate

## Risks / Open Questions
None currently.
