# PRD Index

This folder contains the general PRD plus smaller, scope-specific PRDs.

## Document Versioning
Starting now, PRD documents should include:
- `## Status`
- `## Version` (semantic doc version, for example `v0.4`)
- `## Last Updated` (ISO date, `YYYY-MM-DD`)

Use a version bump whenever requirements meaningfully change. Use date-only updates for editorial clarifications.
