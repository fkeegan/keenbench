# PPTX Formatting Principles

- Prioritize high contrast between text and background.
- Keep title and body typography consistent across slides.
- Limit dense text blocks; use bullets with predictable spacing.
- Use accent colors for emphasis only, not full-paragraph text.
- Maintain alignment consistency for repeated slide patterns.
