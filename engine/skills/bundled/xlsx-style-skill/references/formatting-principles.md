# XLSX Formatting Principles

- Use consistent header styling across all sheets.
- Reserve high-contrast fills for headers and summary rows only.
- Apply numeric `number_format` strings intentionally for currency, percent, and dates.
- Prefer horizontal alignment by data type: text left, numbers right, headings center.
- Use freeze panes for long tables that require persistent headers.
